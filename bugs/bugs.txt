# Project
* Not all tests are being run
* PluginManager tests failing
* Many projects not hooked up

# State graph
* Null pointer exception in the log upon the cancellation of "Input to use for simulation" dialog.
* Hotkey 'm' not activating the simple simulation tool, but rather asking for the input.

* Feature: automaton determinisation.

# Petri Net
* Export non-1-safe Petri nets so they can be processed with petrify.
